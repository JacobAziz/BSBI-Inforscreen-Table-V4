# BSBI Timetable Formatter - Project Summary 14

## Project Overview
The BSBI Timetable Formatter is a web application that transforms raw Excel timetables from the BSBI school system into clean, formatted timetables optimized for information screens. The application extracts key information from complex summary texts, processes them, and presents them in a readable format with session-based themes.

## Current Implementation Status
We now have a fully functional and polished proof of concept with enhanced UI/UX specifically optimized for information screen display, with recent improvements based on school feedback.

### Core Functionality (Previously Established)
1. **Excel Data Processing**
   - Extracts and processes timetable data from Excel files
   - Handles both raw BSBI Excel files and app-exported Excel files
   - Parses complex summary text to extract program, module, and intake information
   - Handles special cases like DBA, Global MBA, and EAP courses

2. **Session-Based Theming**
   - Morning: Bright blue (#4a7fcb) theme
   - Noon: Warm yellow (#F7B32B) theme
   - Afternoon: Dark blue (#1A365D) theme
   - Full background color that permeates the entire timetable
   - Alternating row colors for better readability

3. **Enhanced UI/UX Features (From Previous Sessions)**
   - Perfect text centering (horizontal and vertical) across all table cells
   - Optimized font sizing: `fontSize="xl"` for content, `fontSize="2xl"` for headers
   - Enhanced readability with `fontWeight="semibold"` for content, `fontWeight="bold"` for headers
   - Optimized column width distribution: 27% | 27% | 12% | 24% | 10%

### Major Updates in This Session

#### 1. Date Format Enhancement
- **Previous Format**: `26-05-2025` (dashes)
- **New Format**: `26.05.2025` (dots)
- **Implementation**: Modified `TimetablePreview.tsx` line 58-60
- **Code Change**: 
  ```typescript
  // Before: data.date.split('-').reverse().join('-')
  // After:  data.date.split('-').reverse().join('.')
  ```

#### 2. PNG Download Format Removal
Based on school feedback, completely removed PNG download functionality:
- **Removed**: Entire `downloadAsPNG` function (140+ lines of code)
- **Updated State Type**: Removed `'png'` from `isDownloading` state type
- **Removed UI Element**: Deleted "Download PNG" button from interface
- **Updated Documentation**: Changed all references from "PDFs/PNGs" to "PDFs/JPGs"
- **Updated Help Text**: Changed "PDF or PNG" to "PDF or JPG"

#### 3. PDF Format Resolution Standardization
Unified PDF export to match JPG format with 1080x1920 resolution:
- **Previous**: Variable PDF dimensions based on content scaling
- **New**: Fixed 1080x1920 resolution (same as JPG format)
- **Implementation**: Complete rewrite of `downloadAsPDF` function
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses identical export process as JPG
  - Creates temporary div with exact 1080px width
  - Applies proper logo spacing and styling
  - Uses canvas to ensure exact 1080x1920 output
  - PDF page dimensions set to exactly 1080x1920 points
  - Image fills entire PDF page (no margins)
  - Maintains session background colors

### Current Export Capabilities
1. **JPG Export** - High-quality image (90% quality, 1080x1920 for info screens)
2. **PDF Export** - Professional document format (1080x1920 resolution)
3. **Excel Export** - Editable spreadsheet for re-uploading and modifications
